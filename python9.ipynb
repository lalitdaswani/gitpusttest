This is particularly true after joins and in timeseries data.\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\ndf1 = pd.DataFrame({\\r\\n    'a': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],\\r\\n    'b': [np.NaN, 2, np.NaN, 4, 5, np.NaN],\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\nOut[0]:\\r\\n    a   b\\r\\n0   1   NaN\\r\\n1   2   2.0\\r\\n2   3   NaN\\r\\n3   4   4.0\\r\\n4   5   5.0\\r\\n5   6   NaN\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSee [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79145336/stripna-pandas-dropna-but-behaves-like-strip/79145366#79145366) stack overflow question for more examples (and common workarounds).\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\nPotential solution:\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\n\\r\\ndf1.stripna()\\r\\n\\r\\nOut[2]:\\r\\n    a   b\\r\\n1   2   2.0\\r\\n2   3   NaN\\r\\n3   4   4.0\\r\\n4   5   5.0\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential kwargs to pass could be:\\r\\n- how : {‘any’, ‘all’}, default ‘any’\\r\\n- axis : {0 or ‘index’, 1 or ‘columns’}, default 0\\r\\n- subset : column label or sequence of labels, optional\\r\\n- limit_direction : {{‘forward’, ‘backward’, ‘both’}}, Optional\\n\\n### Alternative Solutions\\n\\nAnother solution would be to add `area_limit` (as in [`ffill`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.ffill.html), [`bfill`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.bfill.html) and [`interpolate`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.interpolate.html)) to `dropna`. From the point of view of extending the API this is probably more intuitive for those with wider pandas knowledge of `ffill`, `bfill` and `interpolate`, however, I would imagine the source code behind `dropna` is written in an element-wise manner so there might be a lot of work to extend it. Just an uneducated guess?\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those coming from a more pure python world, `stripna` is pretty intuitive as more are aware of `str.strip`.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\n_No response_\",\n",

Chi-square tests are useful for understanding associations between categorical variables. While correlation methods like `.corr()` serve to evaluate relationships among continuous data, there is no equivalent method for categorical data.\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers and data analysts who work with categorical data currently need to rely on external libraries or custom code to perform chi-square tests across columns in a `DataFrame` or between two `Series`. \\r\\n\\r\\n**Potential Benefits May Include**\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Swifter Categorical Data Analysis**: Enable exploration of associations within categorical data directly within Pandas.\\r\\n2. **Consistent API**: By mimicking the structure and options of `.corr()`, the `.chi2()` method will feel intuitive.\\r\\n3. **Enhanced Efficiency**: Avoids the need to transfer data between Pandas and other libraries.\\r\\n4. **Optimized for Large Datasets**: Uses Cython to improve performance, making it feasible to compute pairwise chi-square tests even on large datasets.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Potential Use Cases + Target Users**\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Data Scientists** and **Statisticians** performing exploratory analysis of categorical data.\\r\\n- **Researchers** in fields where categorical variables are prevalent.\\r\\n- **Data Analysts** in biz domains where categorical variables are prevalent.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the Titanic data ideal model output could be as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```Python\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nimport seaborn as sns\\r\\n\\r\\ndf = sns.load_dataset(\\'titanic\\')\\r\\ndf.chi2()\\r\\n\\r\\n              sex  embarked    class      who     deck\\r\\nsex       0.00000   0.00126  0.00021  0.00000  0.00774\\r\\nembarked  0.00126   0.00000  0.00000  0.00440  0.05592\\r\\nclass     0.00021   0.00000  0.00000  0.00000  0.00000\\r\\nwho       0.00000   0.00440  0.00000  0.00000  0.00003\\r\\ndeck      0.00774   0.05592  0.00000  0.00003  0.00000\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n### Feature Description\\n\\n**Solution**\\r\\n\\r\\na `.chi2()` method for both `DataFrame` and `Series` classes would provide efficient and consistent code options that will perform these so-called pairwise chi-square tests (and produce a correlation-matrix-like output we could call or think of ass a so-called chi2-matrix):\\r\\n\\r\\n- **`DataFrame.chi2()`**: To perform pairwise chi-square tests for all categorical or integer columns within a `DataFrame`, returning a symmetric matrix similar to the `DataFrame.corr()` method. Users can choose to output either p-values or chi-square statistics, and an adjustable `max_categories` parameter limits the inclusion of columns with too many unique values.\\r\\n  \\r\\n- **`Series.chi2(other_series)`**: Performs a chi-square test between two `Series` objects. It returns either the p-value or chi-square statistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth would have optional `verbose` modes to include degrees of freedom values in the output.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Potential Code `pandas/core/frame.py`**\\r\\n\\r\\n```Python\\r\\nfrom pandas._libs.algos import nanchi2\\r\\nimport numpy as np\\r\\nimport pandas as pd\\r\\n\\r\\nclass DataFrame:\\r\\n    # Other methods ...\\r\\n\\r\\n    def chi2(\\r\\n        self,\\r\\n        output: str = \"p-value\",\\r\\n        max_categories: int = 40,\\r\\n        verbose: bool = False\\r\\n    ) -> pd.DataFrame:\\r\\n        \"\"\"\\r\\n        Compute pairwise chi-square analysis of categorical columns, excluding NA/null values.\\r\\n\\r\\n        Parameters\\r\\n        ----------\\r\\n        output : {\\'p-value\\', \\'chi2stat\\'}, default \\'p-value\\'\\r\\n            Determines output format:\\r\\n            * \\'p-value\\': returns a matrix of p-values from chi-square tests.\\r\\n            * \\'chi2stat\\': returns a matrix of chi-square statistics.

Load a dataset and calculate chi-square for a pair of columns\\r\\n     df = sns.load_dataset(\\'titanic\\')\\r\\n     chi2_result = chi2_contingency(pd.crosstab(df[\\'pclass\\'], df[\\'embark_town\\']))\\r\\n     ```\\r\\n   - This approach requires manually constructing `pd.crosstab` tables for each pair of columns (or doing so in a loop), making it cumbersome for pairwise analysis across multiple columns. It also lacks an optimized and integrated way to produce pairwise matrices directly within Pandas.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Other Third-Party Libraries**:\\r\\n   - There are other libraries like `seaborn` or `statsmodels` facilitate chi-square tests and visualizations which may weigh against implementing this in Pandas. However the same can be said for correlation, which is available in many other libraries.\\r\\n\\r\\nFuilt-in functionality would streamline categorical data analysis within Pandas, aligning with the goal of being a comprehensive tool for data manipulation and analysis.\\n\\n### Additional Context\\n\\nSearched for related issues, found none. However I may have missed them. Thanks to all in the world of Pandas for consideration, review, and efforts.',\n",

I expect KeyError to be raised here as both columns do not exist in the dataframe.\\r\\nUsing `.loc[\"2000\"]` fails and a KeyError is raised as expected.\\r\\nUsing `.loc[(\"2000\",)]` returns the same output as `.loc[2000]`, however, here I would expect a KeyError to be raised for the former (the latter returns the desired and correct output).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Expected Behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nExpect to raise a KeyError, \"2000\" not in axis here\\r\\n\\r\\n### Installed Versions\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : 0691c5cf90477d3503834d983f69350f250a6ff7\\r\\npython                : 3.10.15\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 6.1.100+\\r\\nVersion               : #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Sat Aug 24 16:19:44 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLANG                  : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.3\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.26.0\\r\\npytz                  : 2024.1\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.9.0\\r\\npip                   : 24.2\\r\\nCython                : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nIPython               : 8.28.0\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : 4.12.3\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : 2024.9.0\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : 2024.9.0post1\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.4\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 5.3.0\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.9.2\\r\\nnumba                 : 0.60.0\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : 3.1.5\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npyarrow               : 15.0.0\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npytest                : 8.3.3\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : 1.0.10\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.14.1\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : 2024.9.0\\r\\nxlrd                  : 2.0.1\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : 3.2.0\\r\\nzstandard             : 0.23.0\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.2\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None',\n",

Particularly with the above example, I would expect `df.reindex(['A'], axis=1).shift(freq=day).reindex([], axis=1)` to be equivalent to `df.shift(freq=day)`.\\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit           : 91111fd99898d9dcaa6bf6bedb662db4108da6e6\\r\\npython           : 3.10.13.final.0\\r\\npython-bits      : 64\\r\\nOS               : Linux\\r\\nOS-release       : 5.15.102.hrtdev\\r\\nVersion          : #1 SMP Tue Mar 14 13:23:09 EDT 2023\\r\\nmachine          : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor        :\\r\\nbyteorder        : little\\r\\nLC_ALL           :\\r\\nLANG             : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE           : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas           : 1.5.1\\r\\nnumpy            : 1.23.2\\r\\npytz             : 2022.1\\r\\ndateutil         : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools       : 62.1.0\\r\\npip              : 24.2\\r\\nCython           : 0.29.30\\r\\npytest           : 8.2.1\\r\\nhypothesis       : 6.108.2\\r\\nsphinx           : 5.0.2\\r\\nblosc            : 1.10.6\\r\\nfeather          : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter       : None\\r\\nlxml.etree       : 4.9.1\\r\\nhtml5lib         : 1.1\\r\\npymysql          : 1.0.2\\r\\npsycopg2         : 2.9.3\\r\\njinja2           : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython          : 8.10.0\\r\\npandas_datareader: None\\r\\nbs4              : 4.11.1\\r\\nbottleneck       : 1.3.5\\r\\nbrotli           : 1.0.9\\r\\nfastparquet      : 0.8.1\\r\\nfsspec           : 2023.10.0\\r\\ngcsfs            : None\\r\\nmatplotlib       : 3.5.2+hrt1\\r\\nnumba            : 0.59.0\\r\\nnumexpr          : 2.8.3\\r\\nodfpy            : None\\r\\nopenpyxl         : 3.0.10\\r\\npandas_gbq       : None\\r\\npyarrow          : 12.2.2.dev14+g99c7fc95e\\r\\npyreadstat       : None\\r\\npyxlsb           : 1.0.9\\r\\ns3fs             : None\\r\\nscipy            : 1.9.1\\r\\nsnappy           : None\\r\\nsqlalchemy       : 1.4.49\\r\\ntables           : 3.7.0\\r\\ntabulate         : 0.8.10\\r\\nxarray           : 2022.6.0\\r\\nxlrd             : 2.0.1\\r\\nxlwt             : None\\r\\nzstandard        : 0.20.0\\r\\ntzdata           : 2022.1\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\",\n",
